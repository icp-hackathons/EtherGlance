# Tech Stack and features

We are utilizing a variety of key Ethereum tools and libraries: metamask, truffle, embark, nvm, node.js, filecoin, polygon, The Graph, NFTPort, Covalent, Tableland, ipfs, ethereum and a variety of blockchain protocols and systems. Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of data management bodies, PACS systems deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app provides the requisites features to share medical conditions of the patient and remotely monitor the patient management policies in a place using used phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the families living in a variety of geographical regions. We are utilizing SocialCalc, one of our open source spreadsheet projects and customize it for developing medical monitoring and patient management application. Features include Tabulation that enables the user to enter and edit data in a tabular format; Organization that enables the user to organize the tabular matter in several forms, Facilitates sorting of numeric data, comments to increase ease of understanding of data, names to access data in different modalities, clipboard function; Collaboration and the ability to support sharing of data over the network and multi-user editing and Interoperability between SocialCalc and Excel (.xls format), csv format. Quality Assurance: Our serverless solution equips with two general purpose object detection engines detect symptom types in real-time; better accuracy a bit slower. Our software will turns any PACS system to a seasoned radiologist within the snap of a finger. IPFS; Ethereum is a seamless solution to keep data encrypted and place the immutable fingerprints into blockchain transactions. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect early stage symptoms in real time for better accuracy.
