# Medical DAO

Developer tool to enable tabulation, computation, visualization, data management for developers to build solutions for the bottom of pyramid in the areas of healthcare using Bitcoin, Internet Computer Blockchain and Web3 Tools.


# Internet Computer Blockchain

We are utilizing Internet Computer blockchain for enabling the development of tools and utilities thereby empowering pharma companies and the medical eco-system to do medicine trial testing and clinical trials via blockchain enabled EMTTRs(Electronic Medicine Trial and Test Records as a Service), EHR and Radiology services.

We utilize Internet Computer Blockchain and ICP developer tooling for data analytics, organization and visualization, ZKP and scrypt aided bitcoin wallet, decentralized storage for sorting information obtained from Picture Archiving and Communication Systems.

Medical DAO platform using ICP and b3 wallet, a decentralized, multi-chain wallet with unique support for Bitcoin using Internet Computer’s threshold ECDSA. Also, direct swap for ckBTC/BTC and ICRC standard token, Manage multiple signers and account securely: 

DAOs create a RFP for providing medical counseling to the patients via an ICP enabled twitter like counseling dapp; Doctors can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. Doctors and Medical professionals that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.

We have also developed an ICP Medical Wallet built using ICP, b3 wallet and Zokrates. ICP Medical wallet supports operations like the signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability. We used ICP, b3 wallet and Zokrates for building the ZK based ICP Medical Wallet. We are using b3 wallet platform as a payment solution build on ICP between doctors, medical service providers and patients. Also, as a payment solution between medical insurance providers and patients. Further, we have developed a dashboard for the doctors, patients & the medical insurance providers.

We are developing a backend solution, where the radiology and diagnostic centers can boot a Linux OS by uploading it to an IC Canister.

A virtual disk (An Ubuntu or Debian-minimal PXE image with associated configuration) is uploaded to an IC Canister.

A target host talks to the DHCP server to get the location of the PXE image (ie TFTP server)

PXE requests from the TFTP Server the files and sectors that it needs

TFTP server translates those requests to talk to the IC canister holding the boot artifacts

On the target host, using PXE, a guest VM will be allowed to boot and load its configuration from the TXE server.

OCT SSO workflow: REST service calls required to login to OCP and access information management services (IMS) from OpenText. 


AMAZON ASDI OpenAQ dataset initiative: Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/EtherGlance/tree/main/AWSASDImodule
1. This project utilizes AirQualityQuotient (AQQ) Tool built using AMAZON ASDI OpenAQ dataset and maps it with anonymized radiology chest X Rays data on Orthanc PACS server for early detection of respiratory diseases and infections. 
2. This project also uses UCSC genome browser for sequence and annotations and viewing single cell data. We can click on and hover over cells to get meta information, search for genes to color on and click clusters to show cluster-specific marker genes.

Case Study 1: EHR and Radiology services on the cloud using blockchain network and open source PACS and spreadsheet. EHR as a service aims at providing secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

# Web3 Ecosystem Tools and features

We are utilizing a variety of key Ethereum tools and libraries and Internet Computer Protocol for encrypted solution modules and app development: metamask, truffle, embark, nvm, node.js, filecoin, polygon, NFT.Storage, NFTPort, Sequence, 0vix, Chainlink, Fluence, Spheron, Tableland, ipfs, ethereum and a variety of blockchain protocols and systems. Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of data management bodies, PACS systems deployed at monitoring spots.  

Our app provides the requisites features to share medical conditions of the patient and remotely monitor the patient management policies in a place using used phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the families living in a variety of geographical regions. We are utilizing SocialCalc, one of our open source spreadsheet projects and customize it for developing medical monitoring and patient management application. Features include Tabulation that enables the user to enter and edit data in a tabular format; Organization that enables the user to organize the tabular matter in several forms, Facilitates sorting of numeric data, comments to increase ease of understanding of data, names to access data in different modalities, clipboard function; Collaboration and the ability to support sharing of data over the network and multi-user editing and Interoperability between SocialCalc and Excel (.xls format), csv format. Quality Assurance: Our serverless solution equips with two general purpose object detection engines detect symptom types in real-time; better accuracy a bit slower. Our software will turns any PACS system to a seasoned radiologist within the snap of a finger. IPFS; Ethereum is a seamless solution to keep data encrypted and place the immutable fingerprints into blockchain transactions. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect early stage symptoms in real time for better accuracy.


Long Description

Institutional health records are not always open to other institutions, and institutional or personal health records are not always interoperable. These issues of care coordination are well known in healthcare, and are fundamental problems in medicine.

We are developing an Ethereum blockchain developer library and spreadsheet engine to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity:

Data Transparency : Availability of patient’s medical records across different stakeholder through secure Ethereum blockchain network. The platform utilizes Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, Nucypher i.e. patients and organizations who place their data on the exchange will be able to control which consortium entities have permission to access information. Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. Also records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over course of time. Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction, drug discovery and development.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs helps in improved care coordination. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction and diagnosis of diseases.


We have developed our solution based on a variety of blockchain protocols and solutions.

NFT.Storage: NFT.Storage: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like anonymized patient metadata, medication logs and patient registration at the time of hospital visit. We are storing patient logs and metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting patient metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/EtherGlance/tree/main/patientmetadatanftstorage


Fluence Network: We are using the fluence-js peer implementation in Typescript to connect with our ionic apps which uses typescript as the core for handling application logic. We are using Fluence Network as the Web3 cloud computing provider.
