# EtherGlance

Developer tool to enable tabulation, computation, visualization, data management for developers to build solutions for the bottom of pyramid in the areas of healthcare using a variety of key blockchain protocols and open source spreadsheet (EtherCalc) solutions.


Case Study 1: EHR and Radiology services on the cloud using blockchain network and open source PACS and spreadsheet. EHR as a service aims at providing secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

# Tech Stack and features

We are utilizing a variety of key Ethereum tools and libraries: metamask, truffle, embark, nvm, node.js, filecoin, polygon, NFT.Storage, NFTPort, Sequence, 0vix, Chainlink, Fluence, Spheron, Tableland, ipfs, ethereum and a variety of blockchain protocols and systems. Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of data management bodies, PACS systems deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app provides the requisites features to share medical conditions of the patient and remotely monitor the patient management policies in a place using used phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the families living in a variety of geographical regions. We are utilizing SocialCalc, one of our open source spreadsheet projects and customize it for developing medical monitoring and patient management application. Features include Tabulation that enables the user to enter and edit data in a tabular format; Organization that enables the user to organize the tabular matter in several forms, Facilitates sorting of numeric data, comments to increase ease of understanding of data, names to access data in different modalities, clipboard function; Collaboration and the ability to support sharing of data over the network and multi-user editing and Interoperability between SocialCalc and Excel (.xls format), csv format. Quality Assurance: Our serverless solution equips with two general purpose object detection engines detect symptom types in real-time; better accuracy a bit slower. Our software will turns any PACS system to a seasoned radiologist within the snap of a finger. IPFS; Ethereum is a seamless solution to keep data encrypted and place the immutable fingerprints into blockchain transactions. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect early stage symptoms in real time for better accuracy.


Long Description

Institutional health records are not always open to other institutions, and institutional or personal health records are not always interoperable. These issues of care coordination are well known in healthcare, and are fundamental problems in medicine.

We are developing an Ethereum blockchain developer library and spreadsheet engine to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity:

Data Transparency : Availability of patientâ€™s medical records across different stakeholder through secure Ethereum blockchain network. The platform utilizes Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, Nucypher i.e. patients and organizations who place their data on the exchange will be able to control which consortium entities have permission to access information. Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. Also records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over course of time. Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction, drug discovery and development.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs helps in improved care coordination. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction and diagnosis of diseases.


We have developed our solution based on a variety of blockchain protocols and solutions.

NFT.Storage: NFT.Storage: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like anonymized patient metadata, medication logs and patient registration at the time of hospital visit. We are storing patient logs and metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting patient metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage.
